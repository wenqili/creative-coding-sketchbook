# Creative Coding Sketchbook  

### Brief ###
---
**...Always in progress...**  

This is Eric Wenqi Li's selected works of creative coding sketches. It documents the process of me learning creative coding and computer graphics at [Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP)](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp).

The JavaScript libraries I use include P5.js, Three.js, Processing.js, pixi.js, paper.js and Tone.js.

### Reference ###

Not all my sketches come from nothing. I always get inspired by the amazing and generous creative coding community and stand on their shoulders. I credit the specific inspirations in code documentation.

General reference:  
*   [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/): Daniel Shiffman's amazing creative coding book.
*   [Programming Design System](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/): Rune Madson's slow written book. XD
*   [Open Processing](https://www.openprocessing.org/): A cool processing sketches sharing community
